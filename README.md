Artificial Intelligence Othello Repository
==========================

Welcome to the **Artificial Intelligence Othello** repository! This repository serves as a collection point for various projects related to Artificial Intelligence fundamentals. The projects included here are developed as part of a course, covering topics such as algorithmic complexity, search algorithms, machine learning techniques, and more. The Report is in French, as it's my native language and it was mandatory.

About the Course
----------------

The course delves into the core principles and techniques of Artificial Intelligence, providing a comprehensive understanding of various algorithms and methodologies used in the field. Key topics covered include:

*   Algorithmic Complexity: Understanding the efficiency and scalability of algorithms.
*   Search Algorithms: Implementing algorithms such as Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search for decision-making processes.
*   Machine Learning: Exploring techniques like Reinforcement Learning for training intelligent agents.
*   Game Theory: Applying AI techniques to games like Othello (Reversi) for strategic decision-making.

Project Structure
-----------------

### Othello - Reversi

The **Othello - Reversi** project directory focuses on implementing AI algorithms and strategies for playing the game of Othello (also known as Reversi). The directory contains:

*   **Minimax Algorithm**: Implementation of the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making algorithm used for turn-based games.
*   **Optimizations**: Various optimizations of the Minimax algorithm and to the Board representation to improve efficiency and performance.
*   **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: Implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, another decision-making algorithm suitable for games with large branching factors. (not yet implemented)
*   **Reinforcement Learning**: Utilizing Reinforcement Learning techniques to train AI agents to play Othello. (not yet implemented)
*   **Deep Learning**: Using a database of profesionnal games to train a neural network to play Othello.
*   **Human Interface**: Tools and interfaces to allow human players to interact with and play against AI agents.
